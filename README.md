# Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
Developed by Oladé LAOUROU, this project aims to build and train a deep learning model for identifying and classifying road traffic signs. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras libraries, this project focuses on employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effectively processing traffic sign images.

## Background and Objectives
Automatic traffic sign recognition systems are crucial for autonomous vehicles and driving assistance systems. The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying a variety of road signs from images.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises images of traffic signs categorized into several classes. It is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Each image undergoes preprocessing to be converted into grayscale and is augmented to strengthen the model’s ability to generalize from new data.

## Installation and Setup
### Required Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Install Python and the necessary libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `traffic_sign_classifier.ipynb`.

## Project Structure
- `traffic_sign_classifier.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for data processing, model building and training, as well as evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing data files (`train.p`, `valid.p`, `test.p`).
- `signnames.csv`: Mapping table of class numbers to traffic sign names.

## Modeling and Learning Techniques
The model utilizes an architecture based on recognized networks such as VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3, adapted for grayscale images of traffic signs. The model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification. Training employs techniques like cross-validation, data augmentation (translation, scaling, warping, brightness adjustment), and fine-tuning of hyperparameters.

## Results and Performance
The model has demonstrated a high capability in recognizing and classifying various traffic signs under diverse conditions. Performance metrics, such as accuracy and confusion matrix, are presented to evaluate the classification quality on the test set.
